<p>When Farmer Oskar doesn't watch his cows closely enough, they tend to wander off into the forest to hunt for horse spies.
To catch an enemy agent horse, the cows first lure it onto a trail and then set up fences at the endpoints of the trail,
which are $L$ meters apart. Two previously hidden cows then reveal themselves, having concealed themselves in nearby bushes, and the
chase is on. The cows are located at positions $A$ and $B$ meters from the left endpoint.

<p>One particular horse, positioned $P$ meters from the left endpoint, who they attempted to catch, rembembered to bring his
walke-talkie and have now called for backups. The backups will be there to rescue him very soon, so he wonder if he can hold
the cows off for long enough for his help to come.

<p>Horse chasing happens in 1 minute intervals. During each minute, each of the two cows choose to go either 0 or 1 meter in
some direction. While the cows move, the horse then jump either 0, 1 or 2 meters in some direction as well. This means that
the horse knows where the cows are moving before they arrive at their new location. The horse can jump over a cow though,
if it occupies the same position as a cow it cannot jump over the other cow as well.

<p>The horse is captured if after a one-minute interval, a cow occupies the same position as the hores. How long will
it take for the horse to certainly be captured, if both the cows and the horse move optimally?

<h2>Input format</h2>
The first line of input consists of four integers $1 \le L \le 1\,000, 0 \le A \le L, 0 \le B \le L, 0 \le P  \leL$ as described in the problem statement, separated by spaces.

All the numbers $A$, $B$ and $P$ are distinct.

<h2>Output format</h2>
A single integer, the number of minutes before the cows can catch the horse no matter how the horse moves.
